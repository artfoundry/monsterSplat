Monster Splat
============

Simple web game using Angular JS.

To run, just open app/index.html.

To play, click up, down, left, or right from your hero's position.  Monster moves randomly.  
When you're next to the monster, click on it to splat it!  
If the monster moves into the same space as your hero moves, it eats your hero, and the game is over.
Then reload the page to play again.
